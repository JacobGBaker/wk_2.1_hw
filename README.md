## Homework

This project will give you practice with basic Ruby and hashes.

Each route in this app represents a problem or a solution. The controllers are named accordingly. Most of the meat of this homework lives in the controller's, though. There, you'll find instructions for each problem and space to do your work.

You don't need to change any code in the routes file or any of the views. Just change the code inside the controllers. You'll be able to see solutions in the controllers that have "_solutions" attached to the name.  All the actions are named the same, so you'll be able to easily check your work.
